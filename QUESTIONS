why does Panda Listener exit? do we need a while(true)?

LineDetect calibration could use lookup table for Sin and Cos

Do we need utime to be synchronized between local and remote?

How can we use environment variables on remote for an ssh command?

Log camera and odometry info simultaneously

Do we need to time out for path follower when PoseGenerator dies




THINGS TO IMPLEMENT
//Ibrahim

-PD controller for path follower?
-Camera calibration in both x and y.(intrinsics/extrinsics) I have had it figured out. Just need to implement.
