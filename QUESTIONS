Things to do:
NEED TO FIX SPINNING IN PATH FOLLOWER!!
//Why does path planning hit obstacles?
Why does the exploration code not pick the best frontier?
Logic for shooting targets.
//FASTER IMAGE PROCESSING
Robot gui goals need to be projected from closed loop coordinates to open loop coordinates

Report


Things we finished:
Slam
Image Processing
Calibration
Map Building
Pose generation






Log camera and odometry info simultaneously

Should the covariance for the first pose in slam be 0?

When reobserving a feature, do we need to make a new node for that feature or is it okay if we just add another edge?

FOR ANDREW:
Make sure the map building code will work with a winding theta. Ie a theta on the range [-inf, inf]




THINGS TO IMPLEMENT
//Ibrahim

-PD controller for path follower?
-Camera calibration in both x and y.(intrinsics/extrinsics) I have had it figured out. Just need to implement.
