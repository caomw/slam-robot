Log camera and odometry info simultaneously

Should the covariance for the first pose in slam be 0?

When reobserving a feature, do we need to make a new node for that feature or is it okay if we just add another edge?

FOR ANDREW:
Make sure the map building code will work with a winding theta. Ie a theta on the range [-inf, inf]



THINGS TO IMPLEMENT
//Ibrahim

-PD controller for path follower?
-Camera calibration in both x and y.(intrinsics/extrinsics) I have had it figured out. Just need to implement.
